transparent as possible, whether it's:

## Our Development Process

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well 
as accept pull requests.

## Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to UNCode? You can start by looking through these beginner issues:
**Good first issue** - issues which should only require a few lines of code and a not big understanding of UNCode.

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, 
[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][contribute_github_url].

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase 
(we use [Github Flow][github_flow_url]. 

We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo (in case not an admin) and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.

5. Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
